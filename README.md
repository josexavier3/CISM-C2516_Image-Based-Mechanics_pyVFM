# CISM C2516: Virtual Fields Method - José Xavier

Welcome to the repository for the CISM C2516 course on **Virtual Fields Method (VFM)** - part of the [course on image-based mechanics](https://cism.it/en/activities/courses/C2516/). This repository contains hands-on session materials provided by Prof. José Xavier for the CISM course at UDINE, Italy.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains practical implementations and exercises for VFM analysis:

- **1_VFM_Iosipescu_orthotropic_manuallyVFs**: Manual virtual fields implementation for orthotropic Iosipescu test
- **2_VFM_Iosipescu_orthotropic_piecewiseVFs**: Piecewise virtual fields approach for orthotropic material identification
- **C2516_Flyer_Rethore_Xavier.pdf**: Course information and materials

## Installation and Usage

The code in this repository uses Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) that can be run through a Jupyter Notebook environment. Otherwise, we recommend to use the Jupyter Notebook environment of Anaconda.

To run the code, simply open your Jupyter environment, navigate to the location of the files and open any of the python notebooks (.ipynb files) found in the folders. The subdirectories contain python files or experimental data files that will be called in the main python notebooks.

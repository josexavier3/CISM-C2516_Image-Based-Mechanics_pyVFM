## About This Repository

This repository contains practical implementations and exercises for Virtual Fields Method (VFM) analysis, focusing on the **Unnotched Iosipescu Test for Orthotropic Material**.

**Based on:**  
"The Virtual Fields Method: Extracting constitutive mechanical parameters from full-field deformation measurements" by F. Pierron, M. Grédiac

## Repository Contents

- **1_VFM_Iosipescu_orthotropic_manuallyVFs**: Manual virtual fields implementation for orthotropic Iosipescu test
- **2_VFM_Iosipescu_orthotropic_piecewiseVFs**: Piecewise virtual fields approach for orthotropic material identification
- **C2516_Flyer_Rethore_Xavier.pdf**: Course flyer with detailed information

## Installation and Usage

The code in this repository uses Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) that can be run through a Jupyter Notebook environment. We recommend using the Jupyter Notebook environment provided by Anaconda.

**To run the code:**
1. Open your Jupyter environment
2. Navigate to the location of the downloaded files
3. Open any of the Python notebooks (.ipynb files) found in the folders
4. The subdirectories contain Python files and experimental data files that will be called by the main notebooks

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- (Additional dependencies as specified in the notebooks)

## Reporting Bugs or Issues

Feel free to contact [jmc.xavier@fct.unl.pt] should you encounter any mistakes or bugs in the code!

# Motion Blur Calculator

A tool for analyzing and preventing motion blur in Digital Image Correlation (DIC) measurements during tensile testing. Ensures optimal camera exposure settings for accurate strain measurements.

## üéØ Purpose

During mechanical testing, specimen motion combined with camera exposure time causes motion blur, which can:
- Degrade DIC correlation quality
- Introduce measurement errors
- Reduce strain accuracy
- Cause correlation failures

This calculator determines the maximum allowable exposure time to keep motion blur below acceptable limits (typically ‚â§0.01 pixels for DIC).

## ‚ú® Features

- **Calculate motion blur** based on velocity and exposure time
- **Determine maximum safe exposure** for given test conditions
- **Assess acceptability** against DIC blur criteria
- **Interactive visualization** showing blur vs. exposure relationship
- **Safety margins** and recommendations
- **Multi-velocity analysis** for test planning
- **Modern GUI interface** with real-time calculations

focal_length_mm = 60            # Lens focal length
working_distance_mm = 500       # Distance to specimen
exposure_time_ms = 10           # Exposure time
max_blur_px = 0.01              # Acceptable blur limit
```

## üìã Requirements

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib PySide6

## üí° Usage Tips

### Understanding the Results

#### ‚úì ACCEPTABLE
```
Motion blur: 0.0087 px
Criterion: ‚â§ 0.01 px
Safety margin: 13.2%
```
Your settings are safe. You have 13% margin before reaching the limit.

#### ‚úó UNACCEPTABLE
```
Motion blur: 0.0134 px
Criterion: ‚â§ 0.01 px
Exceeds limit by: 34.2%
Recommended: Reduce exposure to ‚â§ 7.46 ms
```
Reduce your exposure time to the recommended value or lower.

### Optimizing Your Setup

1. **Start with desired velocity** (based on material/standard)
2. **Calculate maximum exposure** using this tool
3. **Adjust lighting** if exposure is too short
4. **Verify correlation quality** in practice

### Common Scenarios

| Test Speed | Typical Max Exposure | Notes |
|------------|---------------------|-------|
| 0.1 mm/min | ~100 ms | Very slow tests, lighting flexible |
| 1.0 mm/min | ~10 ms | Standard rate, moderate lighting needed |
| 5.0 mm/min | ~2 ms | Fast tests, bright lighting required |
| 10 mm/min | ~1 ms | Very fast, high-power lighting essential |

### Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Calculated exposure too short for adequate lighting
**Solutions:**
- Increase lighting intensity
- Use brighter LED arrays
- Reduce test velocity (if possible)
- Use larger aperture lens
- Increase ISO (reduces SNR)

**Problem:** Camera can't achieve required exposure time
**Solutions:**
- Use faster camera with shorter minimum exposure
- Reduce test velocity
- Accept slightly higher blur (test correlation quality)

## üìê Theory

### Motion Blur Calculation

```python
# Specimen displacement during exposure
velocity_mm_s = velocity_mm_min / 60
exposure_s = exposure_ms / 1000
displacement_mm = velocity_mm_s √ó exposure_s

# Convert to pixels using image scale
blur_px = displacement_mm √ó image_scale_px_per_mm
```

### Maximum Exposure Time

```python
max_displacement_mm = max_blur_px / image_scale
max_exposure_s = max_displacement_mm / velocity_mm_s
max_exposure_ms = max_exposure_s √ó 1000
```

### Why 0.01 Pixels?

The 0.01 pixel criterion comes from DIC accuracy requirements:
- DIC can measure displacements to ~0.01-0.05 px accuracy
- Motion blur should be ‚â§ measurement precision
- 0.01 px ensures blur doesn't dominate measurement uncertainty

## üî¨ Practical Example

### Setup
- Material: Aluminum alloy
- Test: Tensile at 1 mm/min
- Camera: 1" sensor, 1920√ó1080 px
- Lens: 50mm focal length
- Working distance: 500mm

### Results
- Image scale: 16.16 px/mm
- Maximum exposure: 9.92 ms
- **Recommendation:** Use 8-9 ms exposure

### Implementation
- Set camera exposure to 8 ms
- Verify adequate brightness
- Start test and confirm correlation quality
